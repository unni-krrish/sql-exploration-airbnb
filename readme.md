- Hosts who have been staying in the platform without identity verification for the longest. 
- Affordable private and shared rooms in Amsterdam subject to many real life search criteria (High acceptance rate, Fast response from the host, Below average price, etc.)
- Query to export data required for further analysis with Tableau, Python, etc.
